# Customer_Churn_using_Naive_bayes

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a Naive Bayes classification task. The project demonstrates the application of the Naive Bayes algorithm for predictive modeling, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares data for model training.

Model Training: Implements Naive Bayes classification using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for performance evaluation.

Visualization: Generates plots for better understanding of the model's performance.

Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher

Jupyter Notebook

Required Python packages:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

Install the required packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Clone the repository:
