# Customer_Churn_using_Naive_bayes
**Goal** 

The goal of this project is to showcase the practical application of the Naive Bayes algorithm in a classification task. It aims to:

* Demonstrate how to preprocess and prepare data for machine learning.
* Train a Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions.
* Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics and visualizations.

**What I Have Done**


**1. Data Loading and Exploration:**

* Loaded the dataset and explored its structure, identifying missing values and outliers.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

* Handled missing values using imputation techniques.

* Encoded categorical variables into numerical formats.

* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**3. Model Training:**

* Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn.

* Trained the model on the prepared training data.

**4. Model Evaluation:**

* Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

* Visualized results using a confusion matrix and classification report.

**5. Insights and Observations:**

* Analyzed the model's strengths and weaknesses based on the results.

* Identified potential areas for improvement or further exploration.

**Features**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares data for model training.

* **Model Training:** Implements Naive Bayes classification using scikit-learn.

* **Model Evaluation:** Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for performance evaluation.

* **Visualization:** Generates plots for better understanding of the model's performance.
